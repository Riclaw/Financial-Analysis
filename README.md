# Financial-Analysis
Here's a set of notebooks where we've tackled various data analysis projects connected to finance concepts. These projects are part of our coursework for '20598 - Finance with Big Data' and have been a collaborative effort between myself, Edoardo Morresi, and Micaela Masia.
Table of contents:
1) Lab1 - Markowitz Portfolio optimization
2) Lab2 - Capital Assets Pricing Model (CAPM) analysis 
3) Lab3 - Sentiment Analysis on financial tweets
4) Lab4 - Predicting Stock Returns with ML
5) Final Project - Modelling Volatility in Option Pricing: Arbitrage Opportunities
